        Light drifts softly, a golden whisper upon the world, Chasing shadows,
        weaving warmth into every corner. It dances on leaves, sparkles on
        water, And spills hope into hearts that wander in darkness. Each ray is
        a promise, each glow a gentle song, Guiding, uplifting, reminding us
        That even in the quietest moments, Light is there—eternal, tender, and
        alive.
